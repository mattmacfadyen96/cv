        <p><em>Aspiring Software Engineer and <strong><a href="https://www.siena.edu/">Siena College Alumni</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a passionate developer that loves working on projects and seeing them to completion.
          I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science from Siena College in Loudonville, NY.
          I have experience with developing industry standard applications. I am interested in all
          aspects of the technology field and would love to get exposure to it and learn more about it.
          I love working with people who are as passionate as I am about technology. </p>
